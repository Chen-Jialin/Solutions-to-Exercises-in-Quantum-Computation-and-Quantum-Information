\begin{exe}
    In Exercise 2.11, which you should do now if you haven't already done it, you compute the eigenvectors of the Pauli matrices. Find the points on the Bloch sphere which corresponding to the normalized eigenvectors of the different Pauli matrices.
\end{exe}
\begin{sol}
    The normalized eigenvectors of $X$ are
    \begin{align}
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\lvert 0\rangle+\lvert 1\rangle),\quad\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\lvert 0\rangle-\lvert 1\rangle),
    \end{align}
    which corresponds to the intersection points of the Bloch sphere and the positive $x$ axis, and of the Bloch sphere and the negative $x$ axis.\\
    The normalized eigenvectors of $Y$ are
    \begin{align}
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\lvert 0\rangle+i\lvert 1\rangle),\quad\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\lvert 0\rangle-i\lvert 1\rangle),
    \end{align}
    which corresponds to the intersection points of the Bloch sphere and the positive $y$ axis, and of the Bloch sphere and the negative $y$ axis.\\
    The normalized eigenvectors of $Z$ are
    \begin{align}
        \lvert 0\rangle,\quad\lvert 1\rangle,
    \end{align}
    which corresponds to the intersection points of the Bloch sphere and the positive $z$ axis, and of the Bloch sphere and the negative $z$ axis.
